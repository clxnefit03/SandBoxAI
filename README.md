## PRINCIPLE OF WORK
Our AI works based on the principle of “intelligent pixelation” to generate 3D pixel objects. The algorithm utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to understand the essential features of a 3D object, including shape, texture, and lighting.
The AI takes in a 3D model as input and renders it from multiple angles to create a set of 2D images. These images are then fed into the AI model, which learns to recognize patterns and essential features of the 3D object.
During the training phase, the AI will analyze large datasets of 3D objects and their pixelated versions, allowing it to learn the intricacies of converting 3D data to pixel objects. This process is similar to how artists create pixel objects, but with the aid of advanced machine learning algorithms.
Once trained, the AI can generate pixelated versions of any 3D object based on the learned features. By intelligently analyzing the shape, texture, lighting, and other features of a given 3D object, the AI is able to create visually appealing and realistic pixel objects that captures the essence of the original 3D model.
